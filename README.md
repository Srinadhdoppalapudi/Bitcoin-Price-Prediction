# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting Bitcoin closing prices using deep-learning-based time series modeling.
The dataset used contains Bitcoin price records from January 2018 through November 2025, prepared and uploaded manually for reliable analysis.

The main goal is to understand price movement patterns and build an LSTM model that can make short-term future predictions.

## What is LSTM?

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks are a type of recurrent neural network designed for sequence-based learning.
They are ideal for financial data because they can:

1) Remember information over long time periods

2) track trends and seasonality

3) handle irregular fluctuations

4) learn how previous prices influence future prices

This makes LSTMs well-suited for cryptocurrency forecasting.
